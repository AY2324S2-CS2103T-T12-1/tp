# CodeConnect User Guide
Hello fellow student developers! Welcome to your one-stop shop for managing developers' contacts!

CodeConnect is a **developer-first networking application** for student developers to keep track of and reach out easily to other student developers, so they can easily form teams for hackathons.

We are **optimised for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**. If you can type fast, CC can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

### What can CodeConnect do for you?
- **Add, Edit, Update, Delete** a student developer's contact details
- Record **Tech Stack** and **GitHub Usernames** for each developer
- **Find** developers by their name, tags, or tech stack
- **Email** developers directly from the app
- **Manage** your hackathon teams by adding your team members to CodeConnect
- **Export** your team details for easy signing up for hackathons

## Features

### Commands

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

- Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG] [ts/TECH_STACK]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend ts/Java` or as `n/John Doe`.

- Items with `‚Ä¶`‚Äã after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]‚Ä¶‚Äã` can be used as `¬†` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

- Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  *Note: Excludes Rate Command.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

- Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

- If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

#### View your previous commands

Any commands you have run previously are saved in the command history, so that you can easily refer to them if you need to.
Any edits you make to a command will be saved while navigating through your history, so you can go to another command
to refer to it, and then return back to your edited command to finish typing.

**How to use:** Use the up and down arrow keys to navigate through your history while the command input is in focus.

#### Saving the data

CodeConnect data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

#### Editing the data file

CodeConnect data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, CodeConnect will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the CodeConnect to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous CodeConnect home folder.

## Known Issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
