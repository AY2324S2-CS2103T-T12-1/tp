# CodeConnect User Guide

Hello fellow student developers! Welcome to your one-stop destination for managing developers' contacts!

CodeConnect is a **developer-first networking application** for student developers to keep track of and reach out easily to other student developers, so they can easily form teams for hackathons.

We are **optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**. If you can type fast, CodeConnect can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

# What can CodeConnect do for you?

- **Add, Edit, Update, Delete** a student developer's contact details
- Record **Tech Stack** and **GitHub Username** for each developer
- **Find** developers by their name, tags, or tech stack
- **Form** and **Manage** your hackathon teams with existing contacts
- **List** all your contacts in the application or within each team
- **Export** your team's details for easy signing up for hackathons
- **Email** your contacts directly from the application

# Usage of User Guide

This guide is designed to help you learn how to use CodeConnect effectively and explore its various features. If you are unfamiliar with programming, don't worry - we have intentionally made it beginner-friendly so that even non-developers will be able to use our guide with ease.

If you're already familiar with CodeConnect, you can skip ahead to the [features](#features), [command summary](#command-summary) or [parameter constraints](#parameter-constraints) sections. <br>
But if you're new to CodeConnect, simply follow along step-by-step to discover how to gather and form your next champion team!

## Keynotes

Before we dive into the guide, let's go over a couple of things to make it more fun for you! Throughout the guide, you'll find some blocks of information that are all jazzed up with colors. They're there to highlight different types of info, so keep an eye out! üåü

<div class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
‚ÑπÔ∏è: The blue block highlights additional information that might be useful in clearing some confusion.
</div>

<div class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">
‚ö†Ô∏è: The yellow block draws attention to crucial information that requires careful consideration to mitigate potential risks or challenges.
</div>

<div class="alert alert-danger" markdown="1">
‚ùó: The red block highlights information that requires immediate attention due to potential irreversible risks.
</div>

Throughout this guide, you'll see some commands highlighted in these cool little boxes:

```
Text in this box is a command
```

See those CAPITALISED words? They're placeholders for your inputs! Don't stress about the exact values right now; we'll get to that later. So, for example:

```
rate INDEX ts/KEYWORD r/RATING
```

You can jazz it up like this:

```
rate 1 ts/Java r/10
```

Also, keep an eye out for [blue](#blue) hyperlinks! They'll whisk you away to other parts of the guide or even other places online.

Alright, now that we've covered the fun stuff, let's dive in and uncover the power of CodeConnect! üöÄüí•

# Features

## General Commands

<div class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">
‚ö†Ô∏è <b>Notes on command format:</b>

- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

- Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG] [ts/TECH_STACK]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend ts/Java` or as `n/John Doe`.

- Items with `‚Ä¶`‚Äã after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]‚Ä¶‚Äã` can be used as `¬†` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

- Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  <i>Note: Excluding Rate Command.</i><br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

- Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

- If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Saving the data

CodeConnect data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. You do not need to save anything manually.

[[Jump to Non-CLI Features]](#non-cli-features) <br/>
[[Jump to Features]](#features)

### Editing the data file

CodeConnect data is saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. If you are an advanced user, feel free to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div class="alert alert-danger" markdown="1">
‚ùó<b>Warning:</b>

- If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, CodeConnect will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
- Furthermore, certain edits can cause the CodeConnect to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

# Known Issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
