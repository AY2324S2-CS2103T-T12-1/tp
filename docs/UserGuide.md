## Usage of User Guide

This guide is designed to help you learn how to use CodeConnect effectively and explore its various features. If you are unfamiliar with programming, don't worry - we have intentionally made it beginner-friendly so that even non-developers will be able to use our guide with ease.

If you're already familiar with CodeConnect, you can skip ahead to the [features](#features), [command summary](#command-summary) or [parameter constraints](#parameter-constraints) sections. <br>
But if you're new to CodeConnect, simply follow along step-by-step to discover how to gather and form your next champion team!

### Keynotes

Before we dive into the guide, let's go over a couple of things to make it more fun for you! Throughout the guide, you'll find some blocks of information that are all jazzed up with colors. They're there to highlight different types of info, so keep an eye out! üåü

<div class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
‚ÑπÔ∏è: The blue block highlights additional information that might be useful in clearing some confusion.
</div>

<div class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">
‚ö†Ô∏è: The yellow block draws attention to crucial information that requires careful consideration to mitigate potential risks or challenges.
</div>

<div class="alert alert-danger" markdown="1">
‚ùó: The red block highlights information that requires immediate attention due to potential irreversible risks.
</div>

Throughout this guide, you'll see some commands highlighted in these cool little boxes:

```
Text in this box is a command
```

See those [SQUARE_BRACKETS] words? They're placeholders for your inputs! Don't stress about the exact values right now; we'll get to that later. So, for example:

```
add t/[TASK_DESCRIPTION]
```

You can jazz it up like this:

```
add t/do OP2 slides
```

<div class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
‚ÑπÔ∏è Remember, no need to copy the `[]`! Just type in the actual values you want to use.
</div>

Also, keep an eye out for [blue](#blue) hyperlinks! They'll whisk you away to other parts of the guide or even other places online.

## Features

### Commands

<div class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">
‚ö†Ô∏è <b>Notes on command format</b>:

- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

- Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG] [ts/TECH_STACK]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend ts/Java` or as `n/John Doe`.

- Items with `‚Ä¶`‚Äã after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]‚Ä¶‚Äã` can be used as `¬†` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

- Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  <i>Note: Excluding Rate Command.</i><br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

- Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

- If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

![email](images/features/features-email.png)

#### View your previous commands

Any commands you have run previously are saved in the command history, so that you can easily refer to them if you need to.
Any edits you make to a command will be saved while navigating through your history, so you can go to another command

#### Saving the data

CodeConnect data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

#### Editing the data file

CodeConnect data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">
‚ö†Ô∏è **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, CodeConnect will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the CodeConnect to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

## Known Issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
