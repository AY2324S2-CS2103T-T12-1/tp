### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of
classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java)
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is
in charge of the app launch and shut down.

- At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
- At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

- [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
- [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
- [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
- [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues
the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

- defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
- implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding
  API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using
the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component
through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the
implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified
in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts
e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ContactListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`,
inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the
visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that
are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of
the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified
in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

- executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
- listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
- keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Contact` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

The **API** of this component is specified
in [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API
call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of
PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `CodeConnectParser` object which in turn creates
   a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which
   is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a contact).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take
   several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

- When called upon to parse a user command, the `CodeConnectParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a
  placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse
  the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `CodeConnectParser` returns back as
  a `Command` object.
- All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser`
  interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

The **API** of this component is specified
in [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

- stores the address book data i.e., all `Contact` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueContactList` object).
- stores the currently 'selected' `Contact` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which
  is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Contact>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to
  this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
- stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as
  a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
- does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they
  should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `CodeConnect`,
which `Contact` references. This allows `CodeConnect

`to only require one`Tag`object per unique tag, instead of
each`Contact`needing their own`Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>

### Storage component

The **API** of this component is specified
in [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

- can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding
  objects.
- inherits from both `CodeConnectStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only
  the functionality of only one is needed).
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects
  that belong to the `Model`)

## Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

---

### Contact Class

The Contact class is a fundamental component of the contact management system within the application.
It represents an individual contact entry, encapsulating various details such as name, contact information, address, GitHub username, associated tech stack, tags, and a profile picture.

<puml src="diagrams/ContactClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

Take note that while contacts may not always have all valid details, such as a missing profile picture, these
null cases should be handled seperately within the ProfilePicture class. A contacts's attribute should never
be left null. This ensures that such invalid cases are always handled in that seperate class, keeping contact lean.

### Team Class

The Team class is another fundamental component of the contact management system. Teams are created to keep track of
groups of contacts, and hold aggregate data about these contacts. These teams are used by the user to keep track of
hackathon teams. Multiple teams are kept track by ModelManager.

<puml src="diagrams/TeamClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

Note that with the use of `UniqueTeamList`, each contact in a team is guaranteed to be unique. However, each contact
may belong in more than one team.

Everytime a new contact is added to a team, team aggregate statistics is recalculated and TeamStats is replaced.

### How the Contact, Team and ModelManager are related

ModelManager keeps track of all Contacts and Teams. Only existing contacts can be added to a Team. They are added
to a team by passing the reference of an existing contact.

<puml src="diagrams/TeamContactModelDiagram.puml" width="550" />

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Command history feature

This feature saves previously entered commands so that the user can easily view them again.

#### Steps to trigger

1. User focuses the command input.
2. User presses the Up arrow key to view the previous command in history, or Down arrow key to view the next.
3. `updateCommandInput()` saves the currently edited command to the command buffer.
4. `next()`/`previous()` in `CommandHistoryView` is called and if a next/previous command exists, the command text field is updated.

The following sequence diagram shows what happens as the user requests to view the command history, and what happens after
the command is executed:
<puml src="diagrams/CommandHistorySequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Sequence Diagram for Command History" />

#### Possible enhancements

- The history size could be made to be configurable by the user.
- The history could be saved to disk so that it persists between app launches.

### Send email directly feature

The following sequence diagram shows what happens as the user double clicks on the email address
<puml src="diagrams/SendEmailSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Sequence Diagram for sending an email" />

#### Possible enhancements

- There can be a feature where multiple emails can be selected to send a mass email to them.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedCodeConnect`. It extends `CodeConnect` with an undo/redo
history, stored internally as `codeConnectStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the
following operations:

- `VersionedCodeConnect#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
- `VersionedCodeConnect#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
- `VersionedCodeConnect#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitCodeConnect()`, `Model#undoCodeConnect()`
and `Model#redoCodeConnect()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedCodeConnect` will be initialized with the
initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th contact in the address book. The `delete` command
calls `Model#commitCodeConnect()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes
to be saved in the `codeConnectStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book
state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new contact. The `add` command also
calls `Model#commitCodeConnect()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into
the `codeConnectStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitCodeConnect()`, so the address book state will
not be saved into the `codeConnectStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the contact was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing
the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoCodeConnect()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer`
once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial CodeConnect state, then there are no
previous CodeConnect states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoCodeConnect()` to check if this is the
case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the
lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoCodeConnect()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `codeConnectStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address
book state, then there are no undone CodeConnect states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoCodeConnect()`
to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such
as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitCodeConnect()`, `Model#undoCodeConnect()` or `Model#redoCodeConnect()`.
Thus, the `codeConnectStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitCodeConnect()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not
pointing at the end of the `codeConnectStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be
purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern
desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.

  - Pros: Easy to implement.
  - Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

- **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  - Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the contact being deleted).
  - Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
