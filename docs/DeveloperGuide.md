## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

#### Main components of the architecture

**`Main`** (consisting of
classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java)
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is
in charge of the **app launch** and **shut down**.

- At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
- At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

- [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
- [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
- [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
- [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

#### How the components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues
the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

- defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
- implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding
  API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using
the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component
through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the
implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" /><br/>
&nbsp; <br/>

**The sections below give more details of each component.**

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified
in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts
e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ContactListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`,
inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the
visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that
are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of
the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified
in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

- executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
- listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
- keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Contact` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

The **API** of this component is specified
in [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API
call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" /> <br/>
&nbsp; <br/>

<div class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
ℹ️ The lifeline for <code>DeleteCommandParser</code> should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of
PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `CodeConnectParser` object which in turn creates
   a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which
   is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a contact).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take
   several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

- When called upon to parse a user command, the `CodeConnectParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a
  placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse
  the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `CodeConnectParser` returns back as
  a `Command` object.
- All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser`
  interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

The **API** of this component is specified
in [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

- stores the address book data i.e., all `Contact` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueContactList` object).
- stores the currently 'selected' `Contact` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which
  is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Contact>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to
  this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
- stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as
  a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
- does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they
  should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
ℹ️ An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below: <br/>

- It has a <code>Tag</code> list in the <code>CodeConnect</code>,
  which <code>Contact</code> references. This allows <code>CodeConnect</code> to only require one <code>Tag</code> object per unique tag, instead of
  each <code>Contact</code> needing their own <code>Tag</code> objects.<br/>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />
</div>

### Storage component

The **API** of this component is specified
in [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

- can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding
  objects.
- inherits from both `CodeConnectStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only
  the functionality of only one is needed).
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects
  that belong to the `Model`)

---

## Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

### Contact Class

The Contact class is a fundamental component of the contact management system within the application.
It represents an individual contact entry, encapsulating various details such as name, contact information, address, GitHub username, associated tech stack, tags, and a profile picture.

<puml src="diagrams/ContactClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

Take note that while contacts may not always have all valid details, such as a missing profile picture, these
null cases should be handled separately within each Attribute's class (in this context, the ProfilePicture class). A contact's attribute should never
be left null. This ensures that such invalid cases are always handled in that separate class, keeping the Contact class lean.

### Team Class

The Team class is another fundamental component of the contact management system. Teams are created to keep track of
groups of contacts, and hold aggregate data about these contacts. These teams are used by the user to keep track of
hackathon teams. Multiple teams are kept track by ModelManager.

<puml src="diagrams/TeamClassDiagram.puml" width="550" /> <br/>
&nbsp; <br/>

<div class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
ℹ️ With the use of <code>UniqueTeamList</code>, each contact in a team is guaranteed to be unique. However, each contact
may belong in more than one team.
</div>

Every time a new contact is added to a team, team aggregate statistics is recalculated and TeamStats is replaced.

### How the Contact, Team and ModelManager are related

ModelManager keeps track of all Contacts and Teams. Only existing contacts can be added to a Team. They are added
to a team by passing the reference of an existing contact.

<puml src="diagrams/TeamContactModelDiagram.puml" width="550" />

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

<div class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
ℹ️ <b>Note from Developers: </b><br/>

- With many commands having similar underlying implementations, our team has deliberately chosen to reduce the length of this section by focusing on unique implementations of features.
- This aligns with the purpose of minimising the overhead from writing and maintaining developer documentation.
</div>

### General Commands

<div class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
ℹ️ <b>Commands Included:</b> <br/> 
List, Add, Edit, Find, Find by Tags, Find by Tech Stack, Rate, Delete, Clear, Exit, Help
</div>

General commands follow the same flow, with only differences deep within the `execute` method of each command.

**In this section, we will focus on the `FindCommand` as an example.**

The following sequence diagram models the interactions between the different components of CodeConnect for the execution of the Find Command.

<puml src="diagrams/FindSequenceDiagram.puml" width="550" /><br/>
&nbsp; <br/>

**Details:**

1. The user inputs the command to find contacts containing the word "John".
2. `FindCommandParser` parses the user input.
3. An `FindCommand` object is created.
4. The `FindCommandParser` returns the `FindCommand` object.
5. The `LogicManager` invokes the `execute` method of `FindCommand`, which finds the contacts containing the word "John" and returns these contacts.

### Team Commands

Team commands follow either one of the two sequences stated below, depending on the command type. Within each flow, the only differences lie in the `execute` method of each command.

#### Sequence 1: Team - Add, Team - Add Contact, Team - Delete Contact

**In this section, we will focus on the `AddTeamCommand` as an example.**

The following sequence diagram models the interactions between the different components of CodeConnect for the execution of the `AddTeamCommand`.
<puml src="diagrams/AddTeamSequenceDiagram.puml" width="550" /><br/>
&nbsp; <br/>

**Details:**

1. The user inputs the command to add a team called "NUS HACKERS".
2. `TeamCommandParser` and `AddTeamCommandParser` parses the user input.
3. An `AddTeamCommand` object is created.
4. The `TeamCommandParser` and `AddTeamCommandCommandParser` return the `AddTeamCommand` object.
5. The `LogicManager` invokes the `execute` method of `AddTeamCommand`, which creates a new team called "NUS HACKERS".

#### Sequence 2: Team - List, Team - Delete, Team - Export

**In this section, we will focus on the `ExportTeamCommand` as an example.**

The following sequence diagram models the interactions between the different components of CodeConnect for the execution of the `ExportTeamCommand`.
<puml src="diagrams/ExportTeamSequenceDiagram.puml" width="550" /><br/>
&nbsp; <br/>

**Details:**

1. The user inputs the command to copy the details of a team specified at index 1.
2. `TeamCommandParser` parses the user input.
3. An `ExportTeamCommand` object is created.
4. The `TeamCommandParser` return the `ExportTeamCommand` object.
5. The `LogicManager` invokes the `execute` method of `ExportTeamCommand`, which copies the details of the team members of the team specified at index 1.

### Command History

This feature saves previously entered commands so that the user can easily view them again.

The following sequence diagram shows what happens as the user requests to view the command history, and what happens after
the command is executed:

<puml src="diagrams/CommandHistorySequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Sequence Diagram for Command History" />

**Details:**

1. User focuses the command input.
2. User presses the Up Arrow Key to view the previous command in history, or Down Arrow Key to view the next.
3. `updateCommandInput()` saves the currently edited command to the command buffer.
4. `next()`/`previous()` in `CommandHistoryView` is called and if a next/previous command exists, the command text field is updated.

#### Possible Improvements

- The history size could be made to be configurable by the user.
- The history could be saved to disk so that it persists between app launches.

### Send Direct Email

The following sequence diagram shows what happens as the user double-clicks on the email address:
<puml src="diagrams/SendEmailSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Sequence Diagram for sending an email" />

#### Possible Improvements

- There can be a feature where multiple emails can be selected to send a mass email to them.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancements**

Team size: 5

<!--Comments for tracking issues, will remove before merging-->
<!--https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/issues/133-->

### 1. Automatically update team in contacts list when `delete-contact` is run

When the members of a team are [shown](UserGuide.md#list-members-belonging-to-a-team) in the contacts list,
[deleting](UserGuide.md#deleting-a-contact-from-a-team-delete-contact) a member of that team does not update the contact list.

A known workaround is to run the command to list the members of the team again, which will show the updated members of the team.

In the future, the `delete-contact` command should be enhanced to detect if the contact list is showing the current members of the
team, and automatically update the contact list to show the updated team if necessary.

<!--https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/issues/154-->

### 2. Support special characters in names for contacts and teams

Currently, CodeConnect does not allow for special characters to be used in names. For example, `s/o` cannot be used in
names even though it would be a valid name because it contains the special character `/`. Other examples include `.` in `Harry S. Truman`,
or `-` in `T-Pain`.

In the future, we plan to expand the restrictions on names to also include special characters such as `/`, `.` and `-`.

The parser in CodeConnect already should be able to parse most special characters without issue, except for `/`,
since it is used to separate prefixes from their values. To solve this problem, we could either use another character instead of `/`
for the prefixes, or use a delimiter to mark the start and end of names so that the parser can ignore any occurrences of special characters in them.

<!--https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/issues/151-->

### 3. Allow different contacts to have the same name

Currently, CodeConnect does not allow for contacts to share the same names. However, different people can have the same
names. Since GitHub usernames already need to be unique, we can use them to prevent duplicate contacts from being added into
CodeConnect, instead of requiring both names and GitHub usernames to unique.

<!--https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/issues/152-->

### 4. Detect when tags with same name but in different case are entered

Currently, CodeConnect does not check if tags with the same name but with different capitalisation exist.
For example, `t/friend` and `t/Friend` can both be added to a contact, which should not be allowed.

In these situations, CodeConnect should treat these two tags as identical. For example, adding `t/friend` and `t/Friend`
to a contact should display an error saying that identical tags cannot be added to a contact.

To achieve this, the `Tag::equals` method can be modified to use `String::equalsIgnoreCase` instead of `String::equals` to compare tags.
When displaying tags, they should all be displayed either in upper or lower case, to show to the user that
tags are treated with case-insensitivity.

<!--https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/issues/152-->

### 5. Detect when tech stacks with same name but in different case are entered

Currently, CodeConnect does not check if tech stacks with the same name but with different capitalisation exist.
For example, `ts/C` and `ts/c` can both be added to a contact, which should not be allowed.

In these situations, CodeConnect should treat these two tech stacks as identical. For example, adding `ts/C` and `ts/c`
to a contact should display an error saying that identical tech stacks cannot be added to a contact.

To achieve this, the `TechStack::equals` method can be modified to use `String::equalsIgnoreCase` instead of `String::equals` to compare tech stacks.
We can also consider saving tech stacks in upper case, which shows a consistent style and prevents the problem of one contact having
`ts/Javascript` but another contact having `ts/JaVaScRipT`. Instead, both contacts would show that they have `ts/JAVASCRIPT`.

<!--https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/issues/147-->

### 6. More specific error messages when parsing `INDEX`

For commands such as `edit`, `delete`, and `rate`, inputting an invalid `INDEX` gives a generic error message, which is
unhelpful for the user. For example, `delete 0` returns `Invalid command format!`.

The command parsers for all commands that take in `INDEX` as an argument should be enhanced to detect when an invalid
input has been given, and output a more specific error message such as
`INDEX should be a positive non-zero integer and not greater than the index of the last contact in the list`.

<!--https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/issues/142-->

### 7. Phone number validation

The current implementation allows a user to add/edit phone numbers with lengths greater than 15 digits. Additionally,
there's ambiguity regarding the format of phone numbers, especially for Singaporean and International contexts.

Since CodeConnect is an application that can be used by anyone around the world, we will ensure that the number of digits
a phone number can contain is between 3 and 15. This gives the user the flexibility to add contacts from anywhere across
the world, which presents especially useful when he/she would like to invite the recipient to join an online hackathon.

<!--https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/issues/122-->

### 8. Inconsistent `rate` command errors

The current implementation allows a user to input an Integer rating only, not a Double or a Long etc. Hence, the error
messages for the different numbers vary.
When the user inputs large numbers, such as `100000000` (an Integer) and `10000000000` (a Long), error messages, `Rating should be between 0 and 10.`
and `Invalid command format!` are displayed respectively.

We intend to enhance the `rate` feature by separating the error handling for ParseException and NumberException into two
with respective error messages.

<!--https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/issues/119-->
<!--https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/issues/117-->

### 9. Prevent adding and editing contacts with duplicate email addresses and phone numbers

Our current implementation supports users to add and edit contacts with email addresses and phone numbers that already
exist in the contact list. However, we understand that this is not applicable in the real life scenario, as every email
address and phone number has to be unique.

We intend to enhance the `add` and `edit` features by implementing a check within the contact list. This check will verify
whether the email address and phone number intended for addition or modification already exists within the contact list.

## **Appendix: Effort**

### Difficulty Level and Challenges Faced

Throughout the development of our project, we encountered several significant challenges that tested our problem-solving skills and collaboration abilities.

One of the foremost hurdles we faced was gaining a comprehensive understanding of the underlying implementation of AddressBook Level 3. As we inherited the codebase from a previous developer, we needed considerable time to unravel the complexities within AddressBook. We meticulously dissected each component, deciphering its role in the application, and strategised on how to extend, modify, or replace existing features to tailor it for our CodeConnect application.

Another major challenge arose during the refactoring process of the pre-existing codebase. The codebase exhibited multiple layers of nesting, making it extremely difficult to refactor classes and methods. This extended into the test cases as well - making changes to one class meant that many of the original tests would have to be refactored to accommodate to modifications. Despite leveraging IntelliJ IDE’s intelligent refactoring features, we encountered difficulties in properly detecting and renaming some classes and methods. This led to instances of broken code, necessitating extensive debugging and testing efforts to rectify.

Additionally, we encountered learning curves as we navigated working together as a cohesive team utilising a Version Control System (GitHub). Merge conflicts were a recurring obstacle, resulting in inadvertent overwrites of previously implemented code. The culmination of these challenges peaked during the integration phase for V1.3, where merging our individually assigned features into the team repository's master branch demanded meticulous coordination and communication.

Despite these formidable challenges, our team persevered with determination and resourcefulness. Each hurdle became an opportunity for growth, reinforcing our collaboration skills, technical acumen, and adaptability in the face of complexity. Through tenacity and a shared commitment to excellence, we successfully navigated these challenges, emerging stronger and more capable as a unified team.

### Effort Required

Developing CodeConnect demanded a significant allocation of effort from each team member. In addition to our regular weekly meetings, every developer was tasked with traversing through the meticulous stages of analysis, design, development, testing, and documentation for every new feature integrated into the application.

Given that we inherited a brownfield project, a considerable amount of time and resources were dedicated to understanding the intricate architecture of AB3. Ensuring compatibility and stability remained at the forefront of our efforts, prompting numerous brainstorming sessions and thorough evaluations of how each new feature would seamlessly integrate.

Furthermore, as not all team members were well-versed in utilising a Version Control System (VCS) within a collaborative setting, considerable effort was expended. Guided by the more experienced members of our team, these individuals diligently worked towards acquiring the necessary proficiency with the VCS. This learning curve should be acknowledged, as mastering a VCS is a substantial step for future software professionals and bears significant importance.

### Achievements of Project

1. Redesigning existing commands for better intuitiveness and fit for our target audience - student developers.
2. Expanded existing search functionalities, empowering users to more efficiently navigate through their contacts.
3. Seamless integration of contacts and teams, enabling users to manage both contacts and hackathon teams.
4. Improved GUI of existing application to accommodate the new teams feature, enabling users to flawlessly transition between team members and contacts in the address book.

### Effort Saved Through Reuse

Approximately 10% of our project's effort was conserved through the judicious reuse of existing components and libraries, particularly in the realm of commands and parsers. Leveraging the established practices of previous developers when modifying the application provided us with a valuable foundation, expediting the implementation of new functionalities.
